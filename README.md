INSTRUCTIONS
-This document is written in reStructuredText. 
-The name of the file is "index.rst". 
-The link to the file is: https://github.com/rajkaramchedu/test/blob/master/index.rst
-The above link renders the view of the reStructuredText and also the "Raw" version has the source code

HTML VERSION
-This document is prepared with Sphinx Documentation System - http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ and hosted on Read the Docs. 
-The html version of this doc is hosted on Read the Docs at this link: http://rajtest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
-The reason to use Sphinx in tandem with Read the Docs is to ensure that anyone who accesses these links will always have the latest version, and we can actually control which version goes live and which one doesn't. Morever, a PDF version is always generated from the latest version on Read the Docs. 

PDF Version
-Sphinx doesn't appear to have a working PDF converter yet. So this is still work-in-progress. However, you can access the not-so-clean version on the Read the Docs page: see a menu on the bottom right that says, "v:latest". Click on it and you'll see PDF option under "Downloads" section. 

Thanks!
Raj
